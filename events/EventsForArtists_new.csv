Her music has been noted by critics for its stylized cinematic quality, its preoccupation with themes of tragic romance, glamour, and melancholia, and its references to pop culture, particularly 1950s and 1960s Americana.In October 2015, Del Rey announced that she planned writing material for her new record. She stated that her last two albums had a `Californian` sound, but if she were to make an album with a `New York` sound it would be a little harder, faster, more upbeat, and less dreamy. In January 2016, Del Rey was nominated with the `Favorite Female Artist` award at the People`s Choice Awards, and she also received a BRIT Award nomination for International Female Solo Artist, her third nomination in the category and fourth overall. In February and March 2016, Del Rey and her managers, respectively, officially revealed that she began working on her fifth studio album, just months after releasing her fourth.In 2016, Del Rey performed on two songs on The Weeknd`s third studio album Starboy. She provided uncredited backing vocals on `Party Monster` and was featured on an interlude entitled `Stargirl Interlude`.",Lana Del Rey,Mercedes-Benz Arena,Berlin,Germany

Lovato's since become a role model for her open struggle against an eating disorder, and a straight up bad b**ch -- Just watch her ""Project X""-esque music video for ""Sorry Not Sorry,"" the first single off the critically acclaimed ""Tell Me You Love Me"".

With a willingness to experiment and cross-pollinate genres, Marshall is redefining what it means to make punk music - or soul, R&B, jazz, hip hop, darkwave, slacker beat poetry, or indie rock, for that matter. Alongside his sublime guitar playing, his distinctive baritone voice adds another layer to his cult underground status, forged, along with his undisputed creative genius, with the critically acclaimed, statement-making debut album 6 Feet Beneath the Moon. After performing here in 2014 and living up to the hype, King Krule returns to New Zealand for his first headline show, joining the Festival Playground line-up for his Auckland Arts Festival debut with songs from his latest album, The Ooz. 2hrs approx.

502,19990911,24169,,2018-02-02T20:00:00,"Sir Roderick David Stewart, CBE (born 10 January 1945) is a British rock singer and songwriter. Born and raised in London, he is of Scottish and English ancestry. Stewart is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold over 100 million records worldwide. He has had six consecutive number one albums in the UK and his tally of 62 UK hit singles includes 31 that reached the top ten, six of which gained the #1 position. Stewart has had 16 top ten singles in the US, with four reaching #1 on the Billboard Hot 100. He was knighted in the 2016 Birthday Honours for services to music and charity.With his distinctive raspy singing voice, Stewart came to prominence in the late 1960s and the early 1970s with The Jeff Beck Group, and then with Faces, though his music career had begun in 1962 when he took up busking with a harmonica. In October 1963, he joined the Dimensions as a harmonica player and part-time vocalist. In 1964, Stewart joined Long John Baldry and the All Stars, and in August, Stewart signed a solo contract, releasing his first single, `Good Morning Little Schoolgirl`, in October. He maintained a solo career alongside a group career, releasing his debut solo album, An Old Raincoat Won`t Ever Let You Down in 1969. Stewart`s early albums were a fusion of rock, folk music, soul music, and R&B.From the late 1970s through the 1990s, Stewart`s music often took on a new wave or soft rock/middle-of-the-road quality, and in the early 2000s, he released a series of successful albums interpreting the Great American Songbook. In 1994, Stewart staged the largest free rock concert in history when he performed in front of 3.5 million people in Rio de Janeiro. In 2008, Billboard magazine ranked him the 17th most successful artist on the `Billboard Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists`. A Grammy and Brit Award recipient, he was voted at #33 in Q Magazine`s list of the Top 100 Greatest Singers of all time,[9] and #59 on Rolling Stone 100 Greatest Singers of all time. As a solo artist, Stewart was inducted into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994, the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2006, and was inducted a second time into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012 as a member of Faces.[",Rod Stewart,Arena Zagreb,Zagreb,Croatia

697,20443470,337140,2017-11-17T10:00:50,2018-04-26T20:00:00,"For mercurial L.A. music-maker Will Wiesenfeld, Baths has been a long time coming. The 21-year-old has spent the better part of his days living amidst ""pleasant"" and ""unremarkable"" in the suburbs of the San Fernando Valley, so perhaps it's due to a general lack of local inspiration that Wiesenfeld's own work has never fit into a prefab box of its own. Over the last six years, under the handle of [Post-Foetus], Wiesenfeld has gainfully explored the intersections and outer reaches of both electronic and acoustic music. With Baths, his eclecticism finds its greatest focus yet, in a hail of lush melodies, ghostly choirs, playful instrumentation and stuttering beats.

Wiesenfeld's trip began at age 4, when he willed his parents into enrolling him in piano lessons. (The family upright, purchased that same year, sits in his bedroom today.) By 13, he'd begun artisting his own music using Digital Performer and a MIDI keyboard -- a brief, ill-advised foray into Eurobeat that was set right when Wiesenfeld heard Bjork for the first time. Mind blown, he quickly boned up on viola, contrabass, and guitar and took the name [Post-Foetus], stringing together countless live configurations to execute his increasingly inimitable compositions. [Post-Foetus]' fourth album -- a Dntel-ish, song-based melange dubbed The Fabric -- was released on Mu-Nest in January.

Though Baths represents the next evolution in Wiesenfeld's oeuvre -- which also includes the excellent ambient project Geotic -- it came together under nigh-opposite circumstances. Last September, [Post-Foetus] was invited by L.A. electronicist Daedelus to share a bill with a handful of local Beat Music luminaries. Witnessing a burgeoning movement firsthand sparked something in Wiesenfeld that the 'burbs never could. In a fit of inspiration, Baths was born, though not into a preexisting scene. As is to be expected, this music goes its own way: fueled by spontaneity, tempered by Wiesenfeld's background in classic songwriting. Those two influences collide in glorious ways on Cerulean, Baths' stunning debut.",Baths,White Oak Music Hall,Houston,United States

705,19497583,45836,2017-08-30T07:55:00,2018-04-10T19:00:00,"It was on the 2nd of February 1968 at the world-famous Marquee Club in Wardour Street that Jethro Tull first performed under that name. The group would go on to become one of the most successful and enduring bands of their era, selling over 60 million albums worldwide and entering the cultural collective consciousness along the way.

To celebrate this golden anniversary, Ian Anderson will present 50 years of Jethro Tull in eight UK concerts during April 2018 as part of the worldwide touring schedule.

The debut album, This Was, was released later that same year. Founder, frontman and flautist, Ian Anderson, is rightly credited with introducing the flute to rock as a front line instrument, not to mention the codpiece! 
 
Jethro Tull are one of the biggest selling Progressive Rock artists of all time and their immense and diverse catalogue of work encompasses folk, blues, classical and heavy rock.  The anniversary concerts will feature a broad mix of material, some of it focussing on the earlier formative period through to the heavy hitters of the Tull catalogue from the albums This Was, Stand Up, Benefit, Aqualung, Thick As A Brick, Too Old To Rock And Roll: Too Young To Die, Songs From The Wood, Heavy Horses, Crest Of A Knave and even a touch of TAAB2 from 2012.
 
Anderson says: 'I am not usually a birthday or anniversary kind of guy but, just for once, I won't be a party-pooper either! I treasure the memories of the earlier years of Jethro Tull repertoire, associated as it is with the adventures of visiting so many countries for the first time to connect with new fans around the world. And this is a celebration of all the 33 band members who graced our ranks - musicians who brought their talents, skills and styles to bear on the performances live and in the studio. Join me and the current band for a nostalgic evening of varied music, representative of my ever-changing songwriting as our careers progressed through the years.'

Ian Anderson will be accompanied by Tull band musicians David Goodier (bass), John O'Hara (keyboards), Florian Opahle (guitar), Scott Hammond (drums) and surprise virtual guests.",Jethro Tull,Symphony Hall,Birmingham,United Kingdom
