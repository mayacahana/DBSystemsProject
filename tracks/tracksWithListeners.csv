They told me I'd find my hopes and my dreams
But I'd long to be, in the bed of my true love
Back where I came from, she's waiting for me

So I'll make my way through long winding country roads
But my heart still beats for my home and my English rose

I told my dad on the phone it's amazing
From the street to the craziest places I've seen
But I'd long to be, in the arms of my true love
Like he loves my mother, he understands me

I spend my days, just travelling and playing shows
But my heart still beats for my home and my English rose

I met a man in the bar down in Memphis
He told me he went there to follow his dreams
He told me ""son, you know I lost my true love
For the same exact reason that you crossed the sea""





And I found truth in people I barely know
But my heart still beats for my home and my English rose

Oh, my heart still beats for my home and my English rose
Oh, my heart still beats for my home and my English rose",2

Glass on the side
I've been sat with you
For most of the night
Ignoring everybody here
We wish they would disappear
So maybe we could get down now

I don't wanna know
If you're getting ahead of the program
I want you to be mine, lady
To hold your body close
Take another step into the no-man's land
For the longest time lady

I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know

This love is a blaze
I saw flames from the side of the stage
And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
Until then we got nothing to say and nothing to know
But something to drink and maybe something to smoke
Let it go until our roads are changed
Singing we found love in a local rave
No, I don't really know what I'm supposed to say
But I can just figure it out and hope and pray
I told her my name and said, ""It's nice to meet ya.""
And then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila.
I already know she's a keeper
Just from this one small act of kindness I'm in deep
If anybody finds out
I'm meant to drive home but I've drunk all of it now, not
Sobering up we just sit on the couch
One thing led to another
Now she's kissing my mouth

I need you darling

Won't you let me know

Can you feel it? All the guys in here don't even wanna dance
Can you feel it? All that I can hear is music from the back
Can you feel it? Found you hiding here so won't you take my hand darling
Before the beat kicks in again
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?

Sing!

I love your hair like that
The way it falls on the side of your neck

Down your shoulders and back

We are surrounded by all of these lights

And people who talk too much

You've got that kind of look in your eyes

As if no one knows anything but us



And should this be the last thing I see

I want you to know it's enough for me

Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need



I'm so in love, so in love

So in love, so in love



You look so beautiful in this light

Your silhouette over me

The way it brings out the blue in your eyes

Is the Tenerife sea



And all of the voices surrounding us here

They just fade out when you take a breath

Just say the word and I will disappear

Into the wilderness



And should this be the last thing I see

I want you to know it's enough for me

Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need



I'm so in love, so in love

So in love, so in love

We make these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
And time's forever frozen still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home

Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier,
Remember that with every piece of you




And it's the only thing we take with us when we die

hearts are never broken
And time's forever frozen still

So you can keep me

That's okay baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won’t ever let you go
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home

You can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul

And if you hurt me
Well, that's okay baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me

Under the lamppost back on Sixth street
Hearing you whisper through the phone,

Of all the comrades that e'er I had
They are sorry for my going away
And all the sweethearts that e'er I had
They would wish me one more day to stay
But since it falls unto my lot
That I should rise and you should not
I'll gently rise and I'll softly call
Good night and joy be with you all

A man may fight and not be slain
A man may court a pretty girl
And perhaps be welcomed back again

I hope that heaven is your resting place

But then that could have been the medicine

Either way I’ll cry with the rest of them.

And my father told me, “Son,
It’s not his fault he doesn’t know your face,
And you’re not the only one.

And we'll lie inside, a little while he wrote
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up
And we’re wrapped in light, in life, in love.
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut
For they’re designed to be together oh




With your body next to mine our hearts will beat as one
And we’re set alight, we’re afire love, love, love oh.

Things were all good yesterday
Then the devil took your breath away
And now we’re left here in the pain
Black suit, black tie standin' in the rain
And now my family is one again
Stapled together with the strangers and a friend.
Came to my mind I should paint it with a pen
Six years old I remember when.

And my father told me, “Son,

And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And darling I will be loving you till we're seventy
And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three
And I'm thinking about how

People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well me, I fall in love with you every single day
I just wanna tell you I am

[Chorus]
So honey, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are

[Verse 2]




When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same
Cause honey your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
And I'm thinking about how

[Pre-Chorus 2]
People fall in love in mysterious ways
And maybe it's all part of a plan
Well I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand

[Chorus]
So, baby, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are

[Chorus]
So baby, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars

Just wish you'd never gone for the man
And waited two weeks at least
Before you let him take you
I stayed true
I kind of knew you liked the dude from private school
He's waiting for the time to move
I knew he had his eyes on you
He's not the right guy for you
Don't hate me cause I write the truth
No I would never lie to you
But it was never fine to lose you
And what a way to find out
It never came from my mouth
You never changed your mind
But you were just afraid to mind out
But f- it, I won't be changing the subject I love it
I'll make your little secret public it's nothing
I'm just disgusted with the skeletons you sleep with in your closet to get back at me
Trapped and I'm lacking sleep




Fact is you're mad at me because I backtrack so casually
You're practically my family
If we married then I'll guess you'd have to be
But tragically our love just lost the will to live
But would I kill to give it one more shot
I think not

I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't want you no
Anymore
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't wanna love you no

Recently I tend to zone out
Up in my headphones to Holocene
You promised your body but I'm away so much
I stay more celibate than in a monastery
I'm not cut out for life on the road
Cause I didn't know I'd miss you this much
And at the time we'd just go, so sue me
I guess I'm not the man that you need
Ever since you went to uni
I've been sofa surfing with a rucksack
Full of less cash and I guess that could get bad
But when I broke the industry
That's when I broke your heart
I was supposed to chart and celebrate
But good things are over fast
I know it's hard to deal with and see this
I tend to turn you off and switch on my professional features
Then I turn the music off
And all I'm left with is to pick up my personal pieces, Jesus
I never really want to believe this
Got advice from my dad and he
Told me that family is all I'll ever have and need
I guess I'm unaware of it
Success is nothing if you have no one there left to share it with

I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't want you no
Anymore
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't wanna love you no
Anymore

And since you left, I've given up my days off
It's what I need to stay strong
I know you have a day job but mine is 24/7
I feel like writing a book, I guess I lied in the hook
Cause I still love you and I need you by my side if I could
The irony is if my career and music didn't exist
In 6 years, yeah, you'd probably be my wife with a kid
I'm frightened to think if I depend on cider and drink
And lighting a spliff I fall into a spiral and it's
Just hiding my misguiding thoughts that I'm trying to kill
And I'd be writing my will before I'm 27, I'll die from a thrill
Go down in history as just a wasted talent
Can I face the challenge, or did I make a mistake erasing?
It's only therapy, my thoughts just get ahead of me
Eventually I'll be fine I know that it was never meant to be
Either way I guess I'm not prepared, but I'll say this
These things happen for a reason and you can't change shit
Take my apology, I'm sorry for the honesty
But I had to get this off my chest

I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't want you no
Anymore
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't wanna love you no
Anymore",19

Keep careful watch of my brothers’ souls,
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke,
Keep watching over Durin’s sons.

Watch the flames climb higher,
Into the night.

And if the night is burning,
I will cover my eyes,
For if the dark returns,
Then my brothers will die.
And as the sky is falling down,
It crashed into this lonely town.
And with that shadow upon the ground,
I hear my people screaming out.

I met this girl, late last year

She said ""don't you worry if I disappear""

I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time, for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me ""I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you can swing by my room around 10
Baby bring a lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM""
Baby if you wanted me you should've just said
She's singing I like them LA LA

Don't f-ck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
I like them LA LA

Don't f-ck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
I like them LA LA

And for a couple weeks I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha
All over the track like a feature
Never wants to sleep, I guess I don't want to either
But me and her we make money the same way,
Four cities, 2 planes the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
Maybe we'll go together and just figure it out!!
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissing him, how I was confused about
Now she should figure it out, while I'm sat here
Singing I like them LA LA

Don't f-ck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
I like them LA LA

Don't f-ck with my love
I told that she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
I like them LA LA

(Knock knock knock) on my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder, I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex
Of course, it's not we were both on tour
We were staying on the same f-cking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment,
but it wasn't never just run and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realized what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
All this time god knows I'm singing
I like them LA LA

Don't f-ck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe

Make it rain





And the seed needs the water
Before it grows out of the ground
But it just keeps on getting hotter
And the hunger more profound
Well I know there can come tears from their eyes
But they may as well be in vain
Even though
I know these tears bring me pain
Even so
And just the same

Make it rain
Make it rain down low
Just make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain down low
Just make it rain
Make it rain

Make it rain (x8)

And the seas are full of water
That stop by the shore
Just like the riches of grandeur
That never reach the port

So let the claps fill with thunderous applause
And let thy death be the veins
And fill the sky
With all that they can drop
When it's time
To make a change",3

Daddy wakes up to a drink at night
Disappearing all night
I don't wanna know where he's been lying
I know what I wanna do
I wanna runaway runaway with you
Gonna grab clothes, socks, in the morning, go
How long could you leave him?
Will dad just don't expect me now
just healing
Oh it could take a bit of time to heal this
It's been a long day almost out of the wrong way
But I love him from the skin to my bones
But I don't wanna miss home
There's nothing to save and he knows
I'll just runaway in the overnight

I've never seen my dad cry
Cold as stone, and the kitche lie
I tell you it's about time




But I was raised to keep quiet
And this is what I'm gonna do
Gonna runaway, gonna make that move
Gonna grab clothes, and when it's morning, go

How long could you leave him?
Will dad just don't expect me now, just healing

There's nothing to save and he knows
I'll just runaway in the overnight

Back pack, and a flat cap
turned to the back
Cause I packed my closet
My dad wasn't in without that plant too bit tired and turns to show up
I don't wanna live this way
Gonna take my things and go
If things change in a matter of days
Could be persuaded to hold up
And mama was the same
None of us the same
To get the good nose up
I don't wanna runaway
And one of these days I might just show that
Put my home in a suitcase
I wrote showlaces, and hold that
Things change, but for now
I leave town with a backpack on my shoulder

But I love him from the skin to my bones
But I don't wanna miss home
There's nothing to save and he knows
I'll just runaway in the overnight",169

Five drinks in on Friday night
We only came to dry your eyes
And get you out of your room

Now this bar has closed it's doors
I found my hand is holding yours
Do you wanna go home so soon?

Or maybe we should take a ride
Through the night
And sing along to every song
That's on the radio
In the back of a taxi cab in Brooklyn no no no
The sun could rise
Burning all the street lamps out at 3AM
So DJ, play it again

Until the night turns into morning




You'll be in my arms
And we'll keep driving
Along the boulevard
And if I kiss you, darling
Please don't be alarmed
It's just the start of everything if you want

A new love
In New York

In New York

Yesterday you gave me a call
Stressing out about it all
Said the world is moving too fast

And you don't know where to begin
'Cause you've spent a lifetime fitting in
Only to wind up on the other side
By yourself
And every day
Screaming out
To all the people that you used to know
From a window that looks upon the Manhattan skyline now
It's just the way that life goes
And you live it in every song you know
So DJ, play it again

Until the night turns into morning
You'll be in my arms
And we'll keep driving
Along the boulevard
And if I kiss you, darling
Please don't be alarmed
It's just the start of everything if you want

A new love
In New York

And every song that plays
Is just like the day you had
And it's okay to cry
But I'm saying that it's a waste of water
You know I'm here for you
In the back of the taxi cab tonight

In New York
It's just reached the morning
And you're still in my arms
Now we've stopped driving
Down the boulevard
And I just kissed you, darling
I hope you weren't alarmed
It's just the start of everything if you want

A new love
In New York

A new life

So live life like you're giving all
Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tell me your path

And I could play the guitar just like ringing the bells
Sometimes I wonder
And any other summer could you have been my part time lover
To me listening to Stevie Wonder
Under the covers where we used to lay
And read these taxes while the speakers play
I'll be on tour almost every day
When I was home up in my flat is where we used to stay
Just watching the DVD, smoking illegal weed
Getting high, two cars, we needed no breathe
We used each other's edge just for the people to see
And stay up all night like when we needed to sleep
We go anywhere, our minds would take us
And also you are beautiful without your make-up
And you don't even need to worry about your wake cards
We can all be loved the way God made us
And time's the only reason that we could break up
Cause you would always tell me I'mma wait too much
Distance is relative to the time that it takes to get on a plane




Or make a mistake, say it again

Oh Nina, you should go Nina
'Cause I ain't never coming home
In a road
won't you leave me now
And I've been living on the road Nina
And then again you should know Nina
Cause that's you and me
Both in a road
won't you leave me now
Now

And every weekend in the winter
You'd be wearing my hood
With jewels, strings pulled tight
To keep your face in the cold
Taking day trips to the local
Where we D on the road
Cause every day when I was a baby
Don't you speak on the phone
Watching Blue Panic
Creating new habits
And if we were two rabbits
And then you vanish
Back to borrow all of the ‘queltics' are disappearing
You call me selfish, I don't understand
But I can't help it
I put my trouble for everything
Except my family and friends
But you'll be in between forever
So I guess we'll have to take a step back
Overlook the situation
Cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications
And I'm not saying we should be taking a break
Just re-evaluating quick before we make a mistake and it's too late
So we kinda need to deal with the pain
We need to get on the plane
But in the day we'll have to say it again

Oh Nina, you should go Nina
'Cause I ain't never coming home
In a road
won't you leave me now
And I've been living on the road Nina
And then again you should know Nina
Cause that's you and me
Both in a road
won't you leave me now
Now

Love will come and love will go
But you can make it on your own
Sing that song, go, oh won't you leave me now
People grow, and fall apart
But you can mend your broken heart
Take it back, oh won't you leave me now

Oh Nina, you should go Nina
'Cause I ain't never coming home
In a road
won't you leave me now
And I've been living on the road Nina
And then again you should know Nina
Cause that's you and me
Both in a road
won't you leave me now

I'm a singer with a flow
I've got a habit of spitting
Quicker lyrics you know
You found me ripping the writtens
Out of the pages they sit in
And never once I get bitten,
Because plagiarism is hidden
Which I would sit on the rhythm,
Prisoner with a vision

Signs of LA, but didn't listen to any criticism
Thought you knew but you didn't
So perk your ears up and listen
Studio with a system
And you could say that I'm driven
And now it's on to the next saga
We drink the best lager
I never tried to win you
Over like your stepfather




I do my own thing now, and get respect after
And I'm avoiding cocaine like it was Get Carter

For four years I never had a place to stay
But it's safe to say that it kept me grounded like a paperweight
At 16 years old I moved out of my home
I was Macy Gray I tried to say goodbye and
I choked
And we've been sleeping at the subway station, sleeping with a movie star and adding to the population
Not my imagination, I don't want to relax
But would it hurt your reputation,
If I put it on wax?

Come on and take it back now
Come on and take it back now
Don't you fade into the back love, oh

Take it back with the rhythm and blues
And my back pack I'll be singing the news,
Trying to act like Jack Black .......
I'll make a beat with my feet by just singing a loop,
Bringing the lyrics to prove that I can fit in these shoes,
And keeping the truth through the vocal booth,
Stars burst out on the scene like an opal fruit,
They try and take aim like beckham when he goes to shoot,
But then again that's what they're supposed to do,
And I'm supposed to be calm,
I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm, whispering everything that happens is from now on,
I'll be willing to start again at the end of the song,
Still they think I handled it wrong,
But then I never had an enemy, except for NME,
But I'll be selling twice as many copies as the magazines will ever be,
And got me spectacles [?] ahead of me and festival fees,
To help me with a Dalmatian, no pedigree,
Singing for the masses,
Rubber dinghy rapids,
Keep this rapping a habit
And keep on passioning magic,
I'm battling with respect,
I don't know if I'll have it,
This songs from the heart,
Grabbing the plaque
I'll take it back now

Come on and take it back now
Come on and take it back now
Don't you fade into the back love, oh

Take it back now
I don't ever want to be perfect,
Cause I'm a singer that you
Never want to see shirtless
I accept the fact that someone has to win the worst-dressed,
Taking my first steps into the scene,
Giving me focus
Putting on a brave face, like Timothy Dalton
Considering a name change,
Thinking it was hopeless
Rhyming over recordings
Avoiding tradition
Cause every day some lyrics
And a melody can be written
Now absence can make your heart ache
But drinking absinthe can change your mind-state, vividly,
I need to let my liver be
And I say it again,
Living life on the edge,
With a closed hand full of friends
Is good advice from a man
Who took his life on the road with me
And I hope to see him blowing up globally
Cause that's how it's supposed to be
Screaming out vocally
Might seem totally impossible
Achieving life's dreams
But, but I just write schemes
I'm never having a stylist, giving me tight jeans
Madison Square Garden is where I might be
But more likely,
You'll find me in the back
Room of a dive bar with my mates
Having a pint with McDaid
Discussing records we made
And every single second knowing
That we'll never betray
The way we were raised
Remembering our background
Sat down
That's how we put it out;
It's time to take it back now

Come on and take it back now
Come on and take it back now
Don't you fade into the back love, oh

Come on and take it back now
Come on and take it back now
Don't you fade into the back love, oh

My dreams keep me awake at night
Written in rhymes, and lies, deliver the hype
Am I just living the lie
With this you must know that the number's just sold woah
Will keep me going through the tough times, dream with me
We forget 90 per cent of it when we wake
But the other 10 per cent it never fades
Dreaming dreams, day to day goals
Stay awake loads, try to make the cut like the
Paper or razor blade, never give up
And just remember just to hold out more
A couple years ago
I couldn't just control that thought
You'd find me buskin' on the street
When it was cold outdoors
And now I'm sweating on the stage
With the sold out tours
Writing love songs for the sake of it
Never to make a hit
You can't fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick
I'm not a rapper I'm a singer, I just take the piss and
Most of these other guys are guys that pose
His little sister has to babysit, that's just a way it is
Dreams you own, just set your goals
And have the utmost faith in it; tread your own path
You'll never make it as a follower, you'll never know
Where you will go or where you will be tomorrow",NULL

There's things we've never said

And they say she's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream, been this way since 18
But lately her face seems slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries, they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

And we're all under the upper hand
Go mad for a couple grams
And we don't want to go outside tonight

In a pipe, fly to the motherland
Or sell love to another man
It's too cold outside for angels to fly
Angels to fly

To fly, fly
For angels to fly
To fly, to fly
Angels to die",NULL

But it won't hold me like you do

Though I try to see you differently

I toe the line


See I'm searching for what used to be mine

And I saw your eyes

Then I saw her staring back at me
So I will try
To find another one who suited me
As well as her
I've moved far away from you
And I want to
See you here beside me dear
but things aren't clear

And we never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
I'd miss you
And I miss you

She was mine
I was hers
And all that's in between
if she would cry
I would shelter her 
And keep her from the darkness
That will be if I moved far away
From you, and I want to
See you here, beside me dear
But things aren't clear

We never even tried
We never even talked

If you cut deep then I might learn
That you
Scarred and left me, like a sunburn
Don't trap me in, it's not my time
if you cut deep then I might lie
And you
Scarred and leave me, like a sunburn

Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
That's you now, ciao, seems that life is great now
See me lose focus, as I sing to you loud
And I can't, no, I won't hush
I'll say the words that make you blush
I'm gonna sing this now

See, I'm true, my songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue, I stick to other artists
I'm not you, now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
See, I'm real, I do it all, it's all me
I'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy
I won't stay put, give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me

I sing and write my own tune
And I write my own verse? Hell
Don't need another word-smith to make my tune sell?
Call yourself a singer-writer. You're just bluffing
Your name's on the credits and you didn't write nothing
I sing fast, I know that all my shit's cool
I will blast and I didn't go to Brit School
I came fast with the way I act, right
I can't last if I'm smoking on a crack pipe

And I won't be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear on Wikipedia
And musically I'm demonstrating
When I perform live, feels like I am meditating
Times at the Enterprise when some fella filmed me
""A young singer-writer like Gabriella Cilmi""

'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all

You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me

'Cause with the lyrics I'll be aiming it right
I won't stop till my name's in light
At Stadium Heights with Damien Rice
On red carpets, now I'm on Arabian nights
Because I'm young and all my brothers gonna give me advice
Long nighter, short height and I'm gone hyper
Never be anything but a singer-songwriter
The games over but now I'm on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal

People think that I'm bound to blow up
I've done around about a thousand shows
But I haven't got a house plus I live on the couch
So you can be the lyrics when I'm singing them out (wow!)

From day one, I've been prepared
With vo5 wax for my ginger hair
So now I'm back to the sofa giving a dose of what the future holds
'Cause it's another day
Plus I'll keep my last name forever keep the genre pretty basic
Gonna be breaking into other people's tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Into another rappers shoes using new laces
Selling cds from my rucksack aiming for the papers
Selling cds from my rucksack aiming for the majors
Nationwide till we're Just Jack, soon as I get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the moustache
I hit back when the pen hurts me
I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee
I'm still the same as a year ago
But more people hear me though
According to the myspace and youtube videos
I'm always doing shows, if I'm not I'm in the studio
Truly broke, never growing up call me *Ruffio
Melody music maker
Reading all the papers
They say I'm up and coming like I'm fucking in an elevator

Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you

On the right side of the wrong bed
And never an excuse I made up
Tell you the truth I what didn't kill me
It never made me stronger at all
Love will scar your make up
Lips sticks to me, so now I maybe lean back there
I'm sat here wishing I was sober
I know I'll never hold you like I used to
But a house gets cold when you cut the heating
Without you to hold I'll be freezing
Can't rely on my heart to beat in
'Cause you take parts of it every evening
Take words out of my mouth
Just from breathing
Replace with phrases like 'when you leaving me?'
Should I? Should I?
Maybe I'll get drunk again
I'll be drunk again, I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love




I wanna hold your heart in both hands
Not watch it fizzle at the bottom of a Coke can
And I got no plans for the weekend, so should we speak then?
Keep it between friends
Though I know you'll never love me like you used to
There maybe other people like us
Who see the flicker of a clipper when they light up
Flames just create us but burns don't heal like before
And you don't hold me anymore
On cold days cold plays out like the band's name
I know I can't heal things with a handshake
You know I can change, as I began saying
You cut me wide open like landscape
Open bottles of beer but never champagne
To applaud you with
The sound that my hands make
Should I? Should I?
Maybe I'll get drunk again
I'll be drunk again, I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love
All by myself, I'm here again
All by myself, you know I'll never change

See a bird soaring high above the flood
It's in your blood, It's in your blood

Underneath the storm an umbrella is saying
Sitting with the poison takes away the pain

Trying to empty out the ocean with a spoon

How come people struggle? How come people

Guilty of nothing

Tides that I tried to swim against

Have brought me down upon my knees

Come out of things unsaid
Shoot an apple off my head and a
Trouble that can't be named
A tiger's waiting to be tamed, singing

You are
You are

Confusion never stops
Closing walls and ticking clocks
Gonna come back and take you home
I could not stop that you now know, singing

Come out upon my seas
Cursed missed opportunities
Am I a part of the cure?
Or am I part of the disease? Singing

You are, you are, you are
You are, you are, you are

And nothing else compares
Oh nothing else compares

There’s spacecraft blocking out the sky
And there’s nowhere to hide
You run to the back and you call on your knees
But it’s the loudest sound you’ve ever heard
And are we trapped like dark cloud’s people
We are helpless to resist
In our darkest hour

But it was just a laugh, just a laugh/lie
Just a laugh, just a laugh
Even at this angle
And so we crumble
To turn heads, you know where it’s at
This dread still covers us
You gotta be kidding me
The grass grows over me
Your face in the glass, in a glass
It was just a laugh, just a laugh
It’s whatever you say it is

And a spacecraft blocking out the sky
And there’s nowhere to hide
You run, look back and you call on your knees

There's an empty space inside my heart
And it won't take root
Tonight I'll set you free
I'll set you free

Slowly we unfurl
As lotus flowers
And all I want is the moon upon a stick
Dancing around the pit
Just to see what it is
I can't kick the habit




Just to feed your fast ballooning head
Listen to your heart

We will sink and be quiet as mice
While the cat is away and do what we want
Do what we want

There's an empty space inside my heart
And now it won't take root
And now I set you free
I set you free

Because all I want is the moon upon a stick
Just to see what it is
Just to see what gives
Take the lotus flowers into my room
Slowly we unfurl
As lotus flowers
All I want is the moon upon a stick
Dance around a pit
The darkness is beneath
I can't kick the habit
Just to feed my fast ballooning head
Listen to your heart",439

From a long, weary dream

The sweetest flowers and fruits hang from the trees


Falling off the giant bird that's been carrying me

It's like I'm falling out of bed from a long and weary dream

Every word
Every gesture
I'm a heart in cold ground

Like I'm falling out of bed
From a long and weary dream
Finally I'm free of all the weight I've been carrying

Every woman blows her cover
In the eye of the beholder
I'm a fish now out of water

Falling off a giant bird that's been carrying me

I fell open
I laid under
At the tip out
I was just a number

I wanna slip it over
And get back under

Then you're wrong
If you think this is over
Then you're wrong

Retrace my steps on what they never taught me

On how the infamous, sensitive N-word control us
So many artist gave her an explanation to hold us
Well this is my explanation straight from Ethiopia

N-E-G-U-S description: Black emperor, King, ruler, now let me finish
The history books overlooked the word and hide it
America tried to make it to a house divided
The homies don't recognize we be using it wrong
So I'ma break it down and put my game in the song

Or say no more. Black stars can come and get me
Take it from Oprah Winfrey

Been feeling this way since I was 16, came to my senses
You never liked us anyway, fuck your friendship, I meant it
I'm African-American, I'm African
I'm black as the moon, heritage of a small village
Pardon my residence
Came from the bottom of mankind
My hair is nappy, my dick is big, my nose is round and wide
You hate me don't you?
You hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture
You're fuckin' evil I want you to recognize that I'm a proud monkey
You vandalize my perception but can't take style from me
And this is more than confession
I mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion
I'm guardin' my feelins, I know that you feel it
You sabotage my community, makin' a killin'
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga

Woi, we feel a whole heap of pain, cah' we black
And man a say they put me in a chain, cah' we black
Imagine now, big gold chain full of rocks
How you no see the whip, left scars pon' me back
But now we have a big whip, parked pon' the block
All them say we doomed from the start, cah' we black
Remember this, every race start from the block, just remember that

I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean
I mean, it's evident that I'm irrelevant to society
That's what you're telling me, penitentiary would only hire me
Curse me till I'm dead
Church me with your fake prophesizing that I'mma be just another slave in my head
Institutionalize manipulation and lies
Reciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes
You hate me don't you?
I know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself
Jealous of my wisdom and cards I dealt
Watchin' me as I pull up, fill up my tank, then peel out
Muscle cars like pull ups, show you what these big wheels 'bout, ah
Black and successful, this black man meant to be special
CAT scans on my radar bitch, how can I help you?
How can I tell you I'm making a killin'?
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga

I'm black as the heart of a fuckin' Aryan
I'm black as the name of Tyrone and Darius
Excuse my French but fuck you — no, fuck y'all
That's as blunt as it gets, I know you hate me, don't you?
You hate my people, I can tell cause it's threats when I see you
I can tell cause your ways deceitful
Know I can tell because you're in love with that Desert Eagle
Thinkin' maliciously, he get a chain then you gone bleed him
It's funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to war
Two tribal armies that want to build and destroy
Remind me of these Compton Crip gangs that live next door
Beefin' with Piru's, only death settle the score
So don't matter how much I say I like to preach with the Panthers
Or tell Georgia State ""Marcus Garvey got all the answers""
Or try to celebrate February like it's my B-Day
Or eat watermelon, chicken, and Kool-Aid on weekdays
Or jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsements
Or watch BET cause urban support is important

When gang banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?

I recognize you're lookin' at me for the pay cut
But homicide be lookin' at you from the face down
What mac-11 even boom with the bass down
Schemin'!
And let me tell you bout my life
Painkillers only put me in the twilight
What pretty pussy and Benjamin is the highlight
Now tell my mama I love her but this what I like
Lord knows, 20 of 'em in my Chevy
Tell 'em all to come and get me, reapin' everything I sow
So my karma come and Heaven no preliminary hearing
So my record and my motherfucking gang can stand in silence for the record
Tell the world I know it's too late
Boys and girls, I think I gone crazy 
Drown inside my vices all day
Won't you please believe when I say

Wouldn't you know, we been hurt, been down before, nigga
When my pride was low, lookin' at the world like, ""where do we go, nigga?""
And we hate Popo, when they kill us dead in the street for sure, nigga
I'm at the preacher's door
My knees gettin' weak and my gun might blow but we gon' be alright

Nigga, we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me?
We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me do you feel me?
We gon' be alright

What you want, a house or a car
40 acres and a mule, a piano a guitar
Anything, see my name is Lucy
I'm your dog, motherfucker you can live at the mall
I can see the evil, I can tell it
I know when its illegal
I don't think about it
I deposit every other zero
Thinkin' of my partner put the candy
Paint it on the regal
Diggin' in my pocket ain't a profit
Big enough to feed you
Everyday my logic
Get another dollar just to keep you in the presence of your chico
I don't talk about it, be about it
Everyday I see cool, if I got it then you know you got it
Heaven, I can reach you
Pet dog, pet dog, pet dog, my dog thats all
Pick back and chat I shut the back for y'all
I rap, I'm black, on track and rest assured
My rights, my wrongs are right till I'm right with God

Wouldn't you know, we been hurt, been down before, nigga
When my pride was low, lookin' at the world like, ""where do we go, nigga?""
And we hate Popo, when they kill us dead in the street for sure, nigga
I'm at the preacher's door
My knees gettin' weak and my gun might blow but we gon' be alright

Nigga, we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me?
We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me do you feel me?
We gon' be alright

I keep my head up high, I cross my heart and hope to die
Lovin' me is complicated
Too afraid, a lot of changes
I'm alright and you're a favorite
Dark nights in my prayers

I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self destruct, the evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went runnin' for answers",NULL

Let these words be your earth and moon you consume every message
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
And with that being said my nigga, let me ask this question:

When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan (one two, one two)
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

And with that being said my nigga, let me ask this question:

When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
Want you look to your left and right, ask you friends
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?





Do you believe in me? Are you deceiving me?
Could I let you down easily, is your heart where it need to be?
Is your smile on permanent? Is your vow on lifetime?
Would you know where the sermon is if I died in this next line?
If I’m tried in a court of law, if the industry cut me off
If the government want me dead, plant cocaine in my car
Would you judge me a drug kid or see me as K. Lamar
Or question my character and degrade me on every blog
Want you to love me like Nelson, want you to hug me like Nelson
I freed you from being a slave in your mind, you’re very welcome
You tell me my song is more than a song, it’s surely a blessing
But a prophet ain’t a prophet til they ask you this question:

When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
Want you look to your left and right, make sure you ask you friends
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it
Let these words be your earth and moon you consume every message
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
And if you riding with me

Do you believe in me? How much you believe in her?
You think she gon’ stick around if them 25 years occur?
You think he can hold you down when you down behind bars hurt?
You think y’all on common ground if you promise to be the first?
Can you be immortalised without your life being expired?
Even though you share the same blood is it worth the time?
Like who got your best interest? Like how much are you dependent?
How clutch are the people that say they love you and who pretending?
How tough is your skin when they turn you in, do you show forgiveness?
What brush do you bend when dusting your shoulders from being offended
What kind of den did they put you in when the lions start hissing
What kind of bridge did they burn, revenge or your mind when it’s mentioned?
You wanna love like Nelson, you wanna be like Nelson
You wanna walk in in his shoes but you peace-making seldom
You wanna be remembered that delivered the message
That considered the blessing of everyone, this your lesson for everyone, say

When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
Want you look to your left and right, make sure you ask you friends
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it
Let these words be your earth and moon you consume every message
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
And if you riding with me

I been wrote off before, I got abandonment issues
I hold grudges like bad judges, don’t let me resent you
That’s not Nelson-like, want you to love me like Nelson
I went to Robben’s Island analysing, that’s where his cell is
So I could find clarity, like how much you cherish me
Is this relationship a fake or real as the heavens be?
See I got to question it all, family, friends, fans, cats, dogs
Trees, plants, grass, how the wind blow
Murphy’s Law, generation X, will I ever be your ex?
Floss off a baby step, mobbed by the mouth a bit
Pause, put me under stress
Crawled under rocks, ducking y’all, it’s respect
But then tomorrow, put my back against the wall
How many leaders you said you needed then left ‘em for dead?
Is it Moses, is it Huey Newton or Detroit Red?
Is it Martin Luther, JFK, shooter you assassin
Is it Jackie, is it Jesse, oh I know, it’s Michael Jackson, oh

When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
That nigga gave us Billie Jean, you say he touched those kids?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it
Let my word be your earth and moon you consume every message
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
And if you riding with me nigga, let me ask this question nigga

""I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in the hotel room
I didn’t wanna self destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went running for answers
Until I came home
But that didn’t stop survivor’s guilt
Going back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes I earned
Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was
But while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city, I was entering a new one
A war that was based on apartheid and discrimination
Made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what I learned
The word was respect
Just because you wore a different gang colour than mines
Doesn’t mean I can’t respect you as a black man
Forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets
If I respect you, we unify and stop the enemy from killing us
But I don’t know, I’m no mortal man, maybe I’m just another nigga”

Shit and that’s all I wrote
I was gonna call another nigga but, it ain’t really a poem, I just felt like it’s something you probably could relate to. Other than that, now that I finally got a chance to holla at you, I always wanted to ask you about a certain situa--, about a metaphor actually, you spoke on the ground. What you mean ‘bout that, what the ground represent?

[2Pac]
The ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil. That’s how I see it, my word is bond. I see and the ground is the symbol for the poor people, the poor people is gonna open up this whole world and swallow up the rich people. Cause the rich people gonna be so fat, they gonna be so appetising, you know what I’m saying, wealthy, appetising. The poor gonna be so poor and hungry, you know what I’m saying it’s gonna be like… there might be some cannibalism out this mutha, they might eat the rich

[Kendrick Lamar]
Aight so let me ask you this then, do you see yourself as somebody that’s rich or somebody that made the best of their own opportunities?

[2Pac]
I see myself as a natural born hustler, a true hustler in every sense of the word. I took nothin’, I took the opportunities, I worked at the most menial and degrading job and built myself up so I could get it to where I owned it. I went from having somebody manage me to me hiring the person that works my management company. I changed everything I realised my destiny in a matter of five years you know what I’m saying I made myself a millionaire. I made millions for a lot of people now it’s time to make millions for myself, you know what I’m saying. I made millions for the record companies, I made millions for these movie companies, now I make millions for us

[Kendrick Lamar]
And through your different avenues of success, how would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity?

[2Pac]
By my faith in God, by my faith in the game, and by my faith in all good things come to those that stay true. You know what I’m saying, and it was happening to me for a reason, you know what I’m saying, I was noticing, I was punching the right buttons and it was happening. So it’s no problem, you know I mean it’s a problem but I’m not finna let them know. I’m finna go straight through

[Kendrick Lamar]
Would you consider yourself a fighter at heart or somebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall?

[2Pac]
I like to think that at every opportunity I’ve ever been threatened with resistance it’s been met with resistance. And not only me but it goes down my family tree. You know what I’m saying, it’s in my veins to fight back

[Kendrick Lamar]
Aight well, how long you think it take before niggas be like, we fighting a war, I’m fighting a war I can’t win and I wanna lay it all down

[2Pac]
In this country a black man only have like 5 years we can exhibit maximum strength, and that’s right now while you a teenager, while you still strong or while you still wanna lift weights, while you still wanna shoot back. Cause once you turn 30 it’s like they take the heart and soul out of a man, out of a black man in this country. And you don’t wanna fight no more. And if you don’t believe me you can look around, you don’t see no loud mouth 30-year old muthafuckas

[Kendrick Lamar]
That’s crazy, because me being one of your offspring of the legacy you left behind I can truly tell you that there’s nothing but turmoil goin’ on so I wanted to ask you what you think is the future for me and my generation today?

[2Pac]
Shit, I think that niggas is tired-a grabbin' shit out the stores and next time it’s a riot there’s gonna be bloodshed for real. I don’t think America can know that. I think American think we was just playing and it’s gonna be some more playing but it ain’t gonna be no playing. It’s gonna be murder, you know what I’m saying, it’s gonna be like Nat Turner, 1831, up in this muthafucka. You know what I’m saying, it’s gonna happen

[Kendrick Lamar]
That’s crazy man. In my opinion, only hope that we kinda have left is music and vibrations, lotta people don’t understand how important it is. Sometimes I be like, get behind a mic and I don’t know what type of energy I’mma push out, or where it comes from. Trip me out sometimes

[2Pac]
Because the spirits, we ain’t really rappin’, we just letting our dead homies tell stories for us

[Kendrick Lamar]
Damn

I wanted to read one last thing to you. It’s actually something a good friend had wrote describing my world. It says:

“The caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it
Its only job is to eat or consume everything around it, in order to protect itself from this mad city
While consuming its environment the caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive
One thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him, but praises the butterfly
The butterfly represents the talent, the thoughtfulness, and the beauty within the caterpillar
But having a harsh outlook on life the caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak and figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits
Already surrounded by this mad city the caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon which institutionalizes him
He can no longer see past his own thoughts
He’s trapped
When trapped inside these walls certain ideas start to take roots, such as going home, and bringing back new concepts to this mad city
The result?
Wings begin to emerge, breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant
Finally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations that the caterpillar never considered, ending the eternal struggle
Although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different, they are one and the same.""

What’s your perspective on that?
