They told me I'd find my hopes and my dreams
But I'd long to be, in the bed of my true love
Back where I came from, she's waiting for me

So I'll make my way through long winding country roads
But my heart still beats for my home and my English rose

I told my dad on the phone it's amazing
From the street to the craziest places I've seen
But I'd long to be, in the arms of my true love
Like he loves my mother, he understands me

I spend my days, just travelling and playing shows
But my heart still beats for my home and my English rose

I met a man in the bar down in Memphis
He told me he went there to follow his dreams
He told me ""son, you know I lost my true love
For the same exact reason that you crossed the sea""





And I found truth in people I barely know
But my heart still beats for my home and my English rose

Oh, my heart still beats for my home and my English rose
Oh, my heart still beats for my home and my English rose",2

Glass on the side
I've been sat with you
For most of the night
Ignoring everybody here
We wish they would disappear
So maybe we could get down now

I don't wanna know
If you're getting ahead of the program
I want you to be mine, lady
To hold your body close
Take another step into the no-man's land
For the longest time lady

I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know
Oh-Oh-Oh-Ooh-Oh

If you love me come on get involved
Feel it rushing through you from your head to toe

This love is a blaze
I saw flames from the side of the stage
And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
Until then we got nothing to say and nothing to know
But something to drink and maybe something to smoke
Let it go until our roads are changed
Singing we found love in a local rave
No, I don't really know what I'm supposed to say
But I can just figure it out and hope and pray
I told her my name and said, ""It's nice to meet ya.""
And then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila.
I already know she's a keeper
Just from this one small act of kindness I'm in deep
If anybody finds out
I'm meant to drive home but I've drunk all of it now, not
Sobering up we just sit on the couch
One thing led to another
Now she's kissing my mouth

I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know
Oh-oh-oh-oh-ooh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-ooh
If you love me come on get involved
Feel it rushing through you from your head to toe

Sing!
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Can you feel it? All the guys in here don't even wanna dance
Can you feel it? All that I can hear is music from the back
Can you feel it? Found you hiding here so won't you take my hand darling
Before the beat kicks in again
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?

Sing!

You've got that kind of look in your eyes

As if no one knows anything but us

I want you to know it's enough for me

Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need

So in love, so in love



You look so beautiful in this light

Your silhouette over me

The way it brings out the blue in your eyes

Is the Tenerife sea



And all of the voices surrounding us here

They just fade out when you take a breath

Just say the word and I will disappear

Into the wilderness



And should this be the last thing I see

I want you to know it's enough for me

But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive

We keep this love in a photograph
We make these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
And time's forever frozen still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home

Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier,
Remember that with every piece of you

And I won’t ever let you go
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home

You can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul

And if you hurt me
Well, that's okay baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won’t ever let you go

Under the lamppost back on Sixth street
Hearing you whisper through the phone,
""Wait for me to come home.""",441

And all the sweethearts that e'er I had

That I should rise and you should not
I'll gently rise and I'll softly call
Good night and joy be with you all

A man may fight and not be slain
A man may court a pretty girl
And perhaps be welcomed back again

Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?

And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three

People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well me, I fall in love with you every single day
I just wanna tell you I am

Just wish you'd never gone for the man
And waited two weeks at least
Before you let him take you
I stayed true
I kind of knew you liked the dude from private school
He's waiting for the time to move
I knew he had his eyes on you
He's not the right guy for you
Don't hate me cause I write the truth
No I would never lie to you
But it was never fine to lose you
And what a way to find out
It never came from my mouth
You never changed your mind
But you were just afraid to mind out
But f- it, I won't be changing the subject I love it
I'll make your little secret public it's nothing
I'm just disgusted with the skeletons you sleep with in your closet to get back at me
Trapped and I'm lacking sleep




Fact is you're mad at me because I backtrack so casually
You're practically my family
If we married then I'll guess you'd have to be
But tragically our love just lost the will to live
But would I kill to give it one more shot

Recently I tend to zone out
Up in my headphones to Holocene
You promised your body but I'm away so much
I stay more celibate than in a monastery
I'm not cut out for life on the road
Cause I didn't know I'd miss you this much
And at the time we'd just go, so sue me
I guess I'm not the man that you need
Ever since you went to uni
I've been sofa surfing with a rucksack
Full of less cash and I guess that could get bad
But when I broke the industry
That's when I broke your heart
I was supposed to chart and celebrate
But good things are over fast
I know it's hard to deal with and see this
I tend to turn you off and switch on my professional features
Then I turn the music off
And all I'm left with is to pick up my personal pieces, Jesus
I never really want to believe this
Got advice from my dad and he
Told me that family is all I'll ever have and need
I guess I'm unaware of it
Success is nothing if you have no one there left to share it with

I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't want you no
Anymore
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't wanna love you no
Anymore

And since you left, I've given up my days off
It's what I need to stay strong
I know you have a day job but mine is 24/7
I feel like writing a book, I guess I lied in the hook
Cause I still love you and I need you by my side if I could
The irony is if my career and music didn't exist
In 6 years, yeah, you'd probably be my wife with a kid
I'm frightened to think if I depend on cider and drink
And lighting a spliff I fall into a spiral and it's
Just hiding my misguiding thoughts that I'm trying to kill
And I'd be writing my will before I'm 27, I'll die from a thrill
Go down in history as just a wasted talent
Can I face the challenge, or did I make a mistake erasing?
It's only therapy, my thoughts just get ahead of me
Eventually I'll be fine I know that it was never meant to be
Either way I guess I'm not prepared, but I'll say this
These things happen for a reason and you can't change shit
Take my apology, I'm sorry for the honesty
But I had to get this off my chest

I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't want you no
Anymore
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't wanna love you no

Watch the flames climb higher,

I met this girl, late last year

She said ""don't you worry if I disappear""

I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time, for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me ""I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you can swing by my room around 10
Baby bring a lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM""
Baby if you wanted me you should've just said
She's singing I like them LA LA

Don't f-ck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
I like them LA LA

Don't f-ck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
I like them LA LA

And for a couple weeks I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha
All over the track like a feature
Never wants to sleep, I guess I don't want to either
But me and her we make money the same way,
Four cities, 2 planes the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
Maybe we'll go together and just figure it out!!
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissing him, how I was confused about
Now she should figure it out, while I'm sat here
Singing I like them LA LA

Don't f-ck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
I like them LA LA

Don't f-ck with my love
I told that she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
I like them LA LA

(Knock knock knock) on my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder, I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex
Of course, it's not we were both on tour
We were staying on the same f-cking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment,
but it wasn't never just run and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realized what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
All this time god knows I'm singing
I like them LA LA

Don't f-ck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
I like them LA LA
Don't fuck with my love
And so that she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
I like them LA LA

Don't f-ck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
I like them LA LA
Don't fuck with my love
And so that she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
I like them LA LA",654

Weigh down in my soul
And the pain of my mother
Will not let me go
Well I know there can come fire from the sky
To purify pure as the canes
Even though
I know this fire brings me pain
Even so
And just the same

Make it rain
Make it rain down low
Just make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain down low
Just make it rain
Make it rain





And the seed needs the water
Before it grows out of the ground
But it just keeps on getting hotter
And the hunger more profound
Well I know there can come tears from their eyes
But they may as well be in vain
Even though
I know these tears bring me pain
Even so
And just the same

Make it rain
Make it rain down low
Just make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain down low
Just make it rain
Make it rain

Make it rain (x8)

And the seas are full of water
That stop by the shore
Just like the riches of grandeur
That never reach the port

So let the claps fill with thunderous applause
And let thy death be the veins
And fill the sky
With all that they can drop
When it's time
To make a change",3

Daddy wakes up to a drink at night
Disappearing all night
I don't wanna know where he's been lying
I know what I wanna do
I wanna runaway runaway with you
Gonna grab clothes, socks, in the morning, go
How long could you leave him?
Will dad just don't expect me now
just healing
Oh it could take a bit of time to heal this
It's been a long day almost out of the wrong way
But I love him from the skin to my bones
But I don't wanna miss home
There's nothing to save and he knows
I'll just runaway in the overnight

I've never seen my dad cry
Cold as stone, and the kitche lie
I tell you it's about time




But I was raised to keep quiet
And this is what I'm gonna do
Gonna runaway, gonna make that move
Gonna grab clothes, and when it's morning, go

How long could you leave him?
Will dad just don't expect me now, just healing
Oh it could take a bit of time to heal this
It's been a long day
Almost out of the wrong way
But I love him from the skin to my bones
But I don't wanna miss home
There's nothing to save and he knows
I'll just runaway in the overnight

Back pack, and a flat cap
turned to the back
Cause I packed my closet
My dad wasn't in without that plant too bit tired and turns to show up
I don't wanna live this way
Gonna take my things and go
If things change in a matter of days
Could be persuaded to hold up
And mama was the same
None of us the same
To get the good nose up
I don't wanna runaway
And one of these days I might just show that
Put my home in a suitcase
I wrote showlaces, and hold that
Things change, but for now
I leave town with a backpack on my shoulder

But I love him from the skin to my bones
But I don't wanna miss home
There's nothing to save and he knows
I'll just runaway in the overnight",169
